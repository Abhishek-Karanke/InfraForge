# InfraForge
Designed multi-tier AWS infrastructure using Terraform for automated resource provisioning and Ansible for configuration management across Dev, Staging, and Production environments. Configured S3 remote state backend with DynamoDB locking to maintain infrastructure state consistency and enable version-controlled infrastructure management. Implemented highly available AWS architecture with custom VPC, multi-AZ deployments, security groups, IAM policies, and reusable Terraform modules to ensure scalability and security.
